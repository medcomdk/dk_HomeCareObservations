## 1 Standard Documentation {#standard}
The standard documentation below provides the necessary content to understand the needs for modernization, the role of the *STANDARDNAME* message, what to implement and how to get a MedCom certificate. The standard documentation for *STANDARDNAME* includes:
  * Clinical Guidelines
  * Use cases
  * Technical Specifications in terms of the relevant IGs and clinical introduction to the content of the IG.
  * *mention other relevant documentation*

### 1.1 Clinical Guidelines for application 
The Clinical Guidelines for application is the foundation for the *STANDARDNAME* standard. It describes the clinical needs for the modernization, the requirement for the content of the standard and how the standard supports the business requirements. It is the primary textual part of the documentation for *STANDARDNAME*. It is important for both implementers and business specialists to understand the Clinical Guidelines for application to ensure that the implemented standard supports the requirements.

Below can the Clinical Guidelines for application in Danish and English be found:

[Danish: Sundhedsfaglige retningslinjer for anvendelse](assets/documents/Clinical-guidelines-DA.md) <br> 
[English: Clinical guidelines for application](assets/documents/Clinical-guidelines-ENG.md) 

### 1.2 Use Cases

Use cases describe the different scenarios a standard support. For a certain real-world scenario, it describes the requirements for the content of a message. The purpose of the use cases is to ensure a coherent implementation and use of the *STANDARDNAME*. The descriptions are targeted IT-system vendors and the people responsible for the implementation in regions and municipalities.

The use cases for HospitalNotification are qualified in collaboration with EPR- and vendors catering to the municipalities.

### 1.3 Technical specification

The technical specification for *STANDARDNAME* standard is composed by profiles form *IG name* 

The profiles that are part of the technical specification for *STANDARDNAME* are: 
 * *Insert link to ImplemantationGuides*

The link below gives an overview of the included profiles, what their purpose is, and which elements the system should support. Further, the structure of the standard is described and supported with examples in different degree of technical skills.

### 1.4 Mapping from OIOXML to FHIR
Short description concerning the previous OIOXML standard that is replaced by STANDARDNAME. 
The document is intended to help translate the previous standard to the new FHIR standard.Furthermore, not all elements from the FHIR elements are represented in the document; thus, it cannot stand alone for implementation. 

## 2 Test and Certification
Certification of a system implies both an approved testprotocol and run-through of TouchStone test scripts. TouchStone describes an infrastructure that allows for automated test and validation against the IG's developed by MedCom. 

 [Click here to find the description of test and certification of FHIR standards in MedCom.](https://tmsmedcom.github.io/GitHubPagesTest/#test-and-certification).
