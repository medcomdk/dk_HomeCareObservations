This page presents MedCom HomeCareObservation (Danish: Kommunale Prøvesvar) standard. The purpose of the standard is to support digital structured communication of results and observations performed and produced by the municipal acute care team.The HomeCareObservation will be sent from the municipal acute care team to the general practitioner on the condition that the general practitioner previously has requisitioned the acute care team to perform an emergency visit. With HomeCareObservation the quality of the results and observations (hereafter mentioned as observations results) are increased as structured data concerning sender, producer of the results, analysis codes and clinical observations, among others, are part of the HomeCareObservation. This allows the general practitioner to easily create an overview of the citizens health data.
 
> Clinical Guidelines and documentation and use cases are in  Danish. The remaining documentation will be in English.
